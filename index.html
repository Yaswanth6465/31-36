    With the recent advancements in computing power, digital signal processing techniques<br>
and data communications a new era in the delivery of medicine and patient management<br>
has evolved. As the underpinning communication systems and infrastructures continue<br>
to develop and move from being fixed or terrestrial in nature to being Internet and mobile<br>
based, we can expect the flexibility and application of Information and Communication<br>
Technologies (ICT) in healthcare to expand.<br>
As the percentage of the elderly within the population increases, we now face the<br>
challenge of healthcare service initiatives driven by the goals of individual autonomy and<br>
quality of life. The results have subsequently produced a manifest shift from institutional<br>
to community care. To improve upon current levels of care provided requires the cost-<br>effective application of ICT. As shown in Figure 1, (Malaysian Telemedicine Blueprint,<br>
2001) this requires the redevelopment of healthcare infrastructures and their service<br>
provision by shifting the allocation of resources from secondary and tertiary-care<br>
institutions towards the preventative management at the primary care level, as well as<br>
providing services to individuals at home where they are likely to be most cost-effective.<br>
Central to the uptake of ICT solutions within healthcare will be the usage of the Internet.<br>
The Internet has the ability to harness the communications between patients and<br>
healthcare professionals and also between healthcare professionals. Such an infrastruc-<br>ture is driven by vast amounts of clinical information, however, care must be taken that<br>
efficient processing takes place to optimize usage of the information collated. One of the<br>
many attributes related to healthcare information is “the notion of time”. The application<br>
of computational approaches that can effectively manage time related healthcare infor-<br>mation has recently been found as not having their full potential exploited (Augusto,<br>
2003a). It has been the aim of this work to focus on these time related healthcare<br>
information issues and show how techniques, capable of effectively managing time<br>
related information, may be employed in the healthcare arena.

        Given the breadth of the subject area addressed in this work, introductory and pertinent<br>
issues have only be presented to provide a more readable article for a broader target<br>
audience. References to further technical information and guidance are provided through-<br>out. The remainder of the work is divided as follows; Section 2 provides an overview of<br>
Internet-based healthcare and decision support systems. Section 3 provides a classical<br>
overview of how temporal reasoning based systems can accommodate for time centered<br>
data and specifically Internet-based healthcare. Section 3 provides three case studies<br>
offering general examples as to how temporal reasoning systems may be employed.<br>
Section 4 provides details on future challenges and visions in this area and overall<br>
conclusions are drawn in Section 5.<br>

        A key component to the facilitation of ICT within healthcare is the usage of Internet<br>
driven technologies (Bushko, 2002). The Internet, coupled with tools such as videocon-<br>ferencing, mobile communications, and digital technologies offer the potential to<br>
significantly improve the processes supporting patient care. Although new and still with<br>
a long way to go before being massively used, Internet-based healthcare is not a futuristic<br>
dream but a reality that is already benefiting a range of communities and healthcare<br>
professionals around the globe. This will inevitability result in patients (and healthcare<br>
professionals) being more frequently confronted with ICT healthcare applications. This,<br>
coupled with the fact that patients are now demanding a larger role in the management<br>
of their own health and healthcare (Beun, 2003), will result in the relationship between<br>
patients and healthcare professionals changing.<br><br>
A major factor related to the role the Internet may offer has been its wide scale uptake.<br>
Figures would now suggest that nearly one in every two people in Western Europe and<br>
the United States have Internet access. This uptake has been propagated into the health<br>
domain with General Practitioners and Hospitals now also having increased access to the<br>
Internet. This subsequently increases the long term potential for Internet driven<br>
healthcare related activities. Figure 2 shows a summary, at a European level, of the<br>
percentages of Internet access in the aforementioned healthcare domains (Beolchi, 2003).<br></div>

        Although beyond the scope of this article to present an in depth coverage of how the<br>
Internet is currently utilized in the healthcare domain, it is nonetheless possible to<br>
identify a number of succinct areas in which it is used by both patients and healthcare<br>
professionals:<br>
<b>Information Provision: </b>The Internet can be effectively used to deliver healthcare<br>
information. Already, the Internet provides an immense resource for patient-healthcare<br>
